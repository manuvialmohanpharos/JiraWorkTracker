# Jira Time Logger for Windows 11

A user-friendly Windows 11 desktop application to log hours to Jira tickets, with features for active time tracking and offline/non-ticketed work.

## Core Features
- Jira Integration: Log time directly to Jira tickets.
- Timer Functionality: Start, pause, stop, and display elapsed time.
- Automatic Pause: Detect workstation lock/logoff and pause timer.
- Tracking Without Jira ID: Track hours without a Jira ID and associate later.
- Simple UI: Intuitive, small window for easy access.

## Technical Considerations
- Jira API interaction (authentication, logging work, validating IDs)
- Windows 11 app development (UI, timer logic, system event handling)
- Local data storage for timer state and logs
